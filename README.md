# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The model utilizes various algorithms and hyperparameter tuning techniques to achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a passenger survived or not.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature encoding.
- Model training with various classifiers: Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes.
- Hyperparameter tuning for k-Nearest Neighbors using Grid Search.
- Evaluation of model performance with accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Final model predictions on test data.

## Model Performance
- **Initial Accuracy of k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** 56.9%
- **Accuracy after Hyperparameter Tuning:** 64.2%
